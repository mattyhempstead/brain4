This is a 343 cm3  cubical device. It has 49 metal rods, placed in a 7x7 grid. This device is placed on touch-responsive areas of the patient's body.
By default all rods are inactive, and upon character selection, HapticRelayer.py maps the selected character to a matrix which represents the character pattern.


I have provided mappings for the default state " " 
as well the characters "1" and "A". 

To setup the rest of the mappings follow these steps:
1) Make 0 and 1 design in "desig.txt" for appropriate character
2) run "python3 formatDes.py" and copy the output into appropriate section of "char_grid_mapper.txt"
3) run "python3 resetDesig.py" to reset "desig.txt" to default state (all 0s)
4) Select a new character and start from step 1 till all characters have been mapped.

HapticRelayer.py shows examples for characters "1" and "A", to observe this run "python3 HapticRelayer.py"
